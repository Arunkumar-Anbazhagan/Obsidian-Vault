# 🚀 Fastest Way to Learn ANY Programming Language: 80-20 rule

**Instructor:** Sahil (Sahil & Sarra)
**Video:** [Fastest Way to Learn ANY Programming Language: 80-20 rule](https://youtu.be/14BL_FwQCpM?si=14BL_FwQCpM)

## 📌 Overview
* **[00:00:00](https://youtu.be/14BL_FwQCpM?t=0)**: Sahil explains how he learned multiple languages (Python, C++, Dart) in weeks rather than months. The secret isn't magic; it's a principle used by history's most effective learners.
* The video applies the **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)** to coding: 20% of the concepts result in 80% of the output.

## ⚖️ The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)
* **[00:01:02](https://youtu.be/14BL_FwQCpM?t=62)**: **Historical Context**: In 1945, the British created "Basic English" consisting of only **850 words** (out of ~170,000 total words) to teach the language globally.
* **[00:02:51](https://youtu.be/14BL_FwQCpM?t=171)**: **The Principle**: 20% of your effort results in 80% of your outcomes.
* **Analogy**: If you analyze a novel like *Fifty Shades of Grey*, ~80% of the text is made up of just the most common ~20% of words (I, me, you, eat, drink).

## 🎯 What to Learn (The "Inner Circle")
* **[00:03:18](https://youtu.be/14BL_FwQCpM?t=198)**: You don't need to learn the entire language documentation. Focus on the **Top 20%** most popular concepts that appear in 80% of codebases.
* **Core Concepts to Master First**:
    1.  **Data Types** (int, float, strings, arrays/lists).
    2.  **Control Flow** (If/Else statements, For Loops).
    3.  **Functions & Classes**.
* **[00:03:59](https://youtu.be/14BL_FwQCpM?t=239)**: **Nuance**: While the concepts are similar, the syntax varies (e.g., `ArrayList` in Java vs `List` in Python). Do research to find the specific "Top 20%" for your target language.

## 🛠️ Method: Interactive Learning
* **[00:04:32](https://youtu.be/14BL_FwQCpM?t=272)**: **Passive vs. Active**: Watching tutorials (Passive) creates a false sense of competence. You must code (Active).
* **[00:04:58](https://youtu.be/14BL_FwQCpM?t=298)**: **"The Art of Breaking Things"**: Programming is about breaking code and fixing it.
* **Recommendation**: Use interactive platforms like **learnpython.org** or **W3Schools** where you can edit and run code immediately, rather than just watching videos.

## 🧠 Solving the Memory Problem
* **[00:05:32](https://youtu.be/14BL_FwQCpM?t=332)**: **Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve**: We forget new information exponentially fast unless we review it.
* **[00:06:19](https://youtu.be/14BL_FwQCpM?t=379)**: **Spaced Repetition**: Revisiting concepts at intervals flattens the forgetting curve. This is how apps like Duolingo work.

## 🏗️ The Ultimate Solution: Breadth-First Project Building
* **[00:07:16](https://youtu.be/14BL_FwQCpM?t=436)**: How do you apply Spaced Repetition *and* learn the remaining 80% of concepts? **Build Projects**.
* **The Strategy**:
    1.  **Build Projects of Increasing Difficulty**: Don't stay in the tutorial loop. Start small, then go bigger.
    2.  **Spaced Repetition**: Projects force you to use the core 20% (Loops, Variables) over and over again naturally.
    3.  **Breadth-First Expansion**: As you build, you will hit roadblocks that force you to look up *one* new concept from the "Outer Circle" (e.g., a specific library). This slowly expands your knowledge circle.

***

**Key Takeaway**: Don't try to memorize a language manual A-Z. Master the core 20% basics, then immediately start building projects. The projects will teach you the rest.
