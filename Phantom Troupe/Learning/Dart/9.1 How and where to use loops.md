# Choosing the Right Loop

In programming, we have 4 main ways to repeat code. While they can often do the same thing, choosing the "Right" one makes your code readable and prevents bugs.

---

## 1. The `for-in` Loop (The "List Reader")
**Rule:** Use this 90% of the time when working with Data.
**Use Case:** You have a collection of items (List, Set, Map keys) and you want to look at *every single one*.

* **Example:** "Show me all the products in my cart."
* **Why:** It is impossible to crash by going "out of bounds" (reading past the end of the list).

```dart
List<String> cart = ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bread"];
for (String item in cart) {
  print("Buying: $item");
}```

Here are your focused notes on **Use Cases for Loops**. This guide specifically answers the question: _"Which loop do I choose for this problem?"_

## 2. The Standard `for` Loop (The "Counter")

**Rule:** Use this when the **Index (Position)** matters, or when you need to count numbers mathematically. **Use Case:** You need to know _where_ an item is, or you need to step by a specific number (e.g., every 2nd item).

- **Example 1 (Index):** "Print a numbered list like '1. Milk', '2. Eggs'."
    
- **Example 2 (Math):** "Count down from 10 to 1."
    
```Dart
List<String> racers = ["Mario", "Luigi", "Yoshi"];
for (int i = 0; i < racers.length; i++) {
  // We need 'i' to print the rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
  print("Rank ${i + 1}: ${racers[i]}");
}
```

---
## 3. The `while` Loop (The "Waiter")

**Rule:** Use this when you **don't know** how many times the loop will run. It runs until a condition changes. **Use Case:** Waiting for an external event or valid input.

- **Example:** "Keep trying to connect to the server until connected."
    
- **Example:** "Keep asking for a password until the user types the right one."

```Dart
bool isConnected = false;
while (isConnected == false) {
  print("Connecting...");
  // ... code to try connection ...
  // If successful, isConnected becomes true, and loop stops.
}
```

## 4. The `do-while` Loop (The "First-Time Guarantor")

**Rule:** Use this rarely. Only use it if the code **MUST** run at least once, even if the condition is false to begin with. **Use Case:** User menus where you show the options first, _then_ ask if they want to quit.

- **Example:** "Show the ATM menu. After the transaction, ask if they want another one."


```Dart
String input;
do {
  print("1. Withdraw");
  print("2. Deposit");
  // ... get input ...
} while (input != "exit");
```

## Summary

| Action to perform            | Use Loop                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Read every item in a List    | **`for-in`** (Cleaner & Safer) |
| Know the index (0, 1, 2)     | **`for`**                      |
| Count numbers (1 to 100)     | **`for`**                      |
| Wait for something to happen | **`while`**                    |
| Show a menu at least once    | **`do-while`**                 |
