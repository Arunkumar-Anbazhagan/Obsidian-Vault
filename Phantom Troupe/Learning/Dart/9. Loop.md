# Topic 11: Loops (Control Flow)

**Definition:** Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. This is essential for processing lists, repeating tasks, or waiting for conditions to change.

---

## 1. The Standard `for` Loop
**Best for:** When you know exactly how many times you want to iterate (e.g., "Run this 10 times"). It relies on an index counter (usually `i`).

### Syntax
`for (initialization; condition; increment)`

### Example
```dart
void main() {
  // 1. int i = 0  -> Start the counter at 0
  // 2. i < 5      -> Run as long as i is less than 5 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
  // 3. i++        -> Add 1 to i after every cycle
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    print("Cycle count: $i");
  }
}
```

## 2. The `for-in` Loop (Collections)
**Best for:** Iterating through Lists. It is cleaner and safer than the standard `for` loop because you cannot accidentally access an invalid index.

### Syntax
`for (Type variableName in listName)`

### Example
```dart
void main() {
  List<String> servers = ["Server A", "Server B", "Server C"];

  // "server" is a temporary variable holding the current item
  // The loop runs 3 times, once for each item in the list
  for (String server in servers) {
    print("Connecting to $server...");
  }
}
```

---

## 3. The `while` Loop
**Best for:** When you **don't know** how many times the loop needs to run. It runs *while* a specific condition is true.
**Warning:** You must manually update the variable inside the loop, or you will create an "Infinite Loop" that freezes your app.

### Example
```dart
void main() {
  int battery = 10;

  // Keep looping while battery is greater than 0
  while (battery > 0) {
    print("Battery at $battery%... still running.");
    
    // CRUCIAL: You must change the condition variable inside the loop
    battery -= 2; 
  }
  
  print("Phone died.");
}
```

---

## 4. The `do-while` Loop
**Best for:** When you need the code to run **at least once**, regardless of the condition. The condition is checked *after* the code runs.

### Example
```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  String input;
  
  // This block runs once BEFORE checking the condition
  do {
    print("Type 'exit' to quit:");
    input = stdin.readLineSync()!;
    print("You typed: $input");
    
  } while (input != "exit"); // Loop repeats if input is NOT 'exit'
  
  print("Goodbye!");
}
```

---

## 5. Loop Control: `break` and `continue`
Sometimes you need to interrupt a loop mid-way.

### `break` (Stop completely)
Immediately kills the loop. Useful for searching.

```dart
void main() {
  List<int> numbers = [1, 5, 8, 20, 3];

  for (int num in numbers) {
    if (num > 10) {
      print("Found a large number: $num. Stopping.");
      break; // Exits the loop entirely. "3" is never checked.
    }
    print("Checking $num...");
  }
}
```

### `continue` (Skip this one)
Skips the rest of the *current* cycle and jumps to the next one.

```dart
void main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
      print("Skipping number 3...");
      continue; // Jump back to start of loop. Don't print "Processed 3".
    }
    print("Processed number $i");
  }
}
```

## Summary Table

| Loop Type | When to use? |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`for`** | When you need an index (`i`) or a specific count. |
| **`for-in`** | **Most Common.** The best way to read Lists. |
| **`while`** | When looping based on a condition (like waiting for data). |
| **`do-while`** | When the code must execute at least once (like a menu). |
