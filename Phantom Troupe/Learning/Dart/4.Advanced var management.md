# Topic 4: Advanced Variable Management

## 1. Type Inference (`var`)
* **Concept:** Dart automatically detects the data type based on the initial value.
* **Rule:** Once inferred, the type is **locked**.
* **Syntax:** `var variableName = value;`
* **Reference:** [Type Inference Explained - 02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoQH2ghodPE&t=135s)

## 2. Dynamic Type (`dynamic`)
* **Concept:** A variable that can hold *any* type and change types later.
* **Risk:** Disables static type checking, leading to potential runtime crashes.
* **Usage:** Use only when the type is truly unknown (e.g., parsing complex JSON).

## 3. Immutability (Unchangeable Variables)
Creating variables that cannot be changed makes apps more predictable and faster.

### A. Final (`final`)
* **Definition:** Single-assignment variable. Value is determined when the code *runs*.
* **Use Case:** content that is fixed, but unique to this run (e.g., HTTP response, Form input).
* **Code:** `final String username = getUserInput();`
* **Reference:** [Final vs Const - 05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoQH2ghodPE&t=340s)

### B. Const (`const`)
* **Definition:** Compile-time constant. Value must be known *before* the app runs.
* **Use Case:** Math constants, text labels, colors, widget settings.
* **Code:** `const double pi = 3.14159;`
* **Performance:** `const` is faster because the computer calculates it once and never again.


## 1. The Golden Rule
> **Rule:** If you can calculate the value on a calculator *without* running the app, use `const`. If you need the app to be running to know the value, use `final`.

## 2. Why your code failed
```dart
void main() {
  // ❌ ERROR: The computer can't know 'now' before the app runs.
  const time = DateTime.now(); 

  // ✅ CORRECT: We will know 'now' once the line executes.
  final time = DateTime.now(); 
}
