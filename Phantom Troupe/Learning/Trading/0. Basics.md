# The Definitive Guide to Stock Market Analysis

## 1. Fundamental Analysis (FA)
*Focus: Measuring a security's **Intrinsic Value** by examining related economic and financial factors.*

### A. The Financial Statements (The Quantitative Core)
To analyze a company, you must look at its official filings (Form 10-K or 10-Q).
* **Income Statement:** Reports revenue, expenses, and net profit over a period.
* **Balance Sheet:** A snapshot of what the company owns (Assets) and owes (Liabilities).
    * *Official Formula:* $Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity$
* **Cash Flow Statement:** Shows how cash moves. Crucial for determining if profits are actually becoming "liquid cash."

### B. Qualitative Factors (The Business Narrative)
* **Economic Moat:** A competitive advantage (brand, patent, or scale) that protects the business.
* **Management:** Resumes and past performance of the Board and CEO.
* **Industry Analysis:** The overall health of the sector the company operates in.

### C. Key Valuation Ratios
* **P/E Ratio:** $Price / Earnings$. Measures how much you pay for $1 of profit.
* **Debt-to-Equity:** Measures financial leverage. High ratios often indicate higher risk.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** $Net\ Income / Shareholders'\ Equity$. Measures management efficiency.

## 2. Technical Analysis (TA)
*Focus: Forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily **price and volume**.*

### A. Price Action & Trends
* **The Trend:** Markets move in three directions: **Uptrend** (Higher Highs/Lows), **Downtrend** (Lower Highs/Lows), and **Sideways**.
* **Support & Resistance:** * *Support:* A "floor" where buying pressure stops a price drop.
    * *Resistance:* A "ceiling" where selling pressure stops a price rise.



### B. Chart Patterns (Visual Psychology)
Patterns represent the collective behavior of traders.
* **Reversal Patterns:** Head & Shoulders, Double Tops/Bottoms.
* **Continuation Patterns:** Flags, Pennants, and Cups-and-Handles.

### C. Technical Indicators
* **Moving Averages (MA):** Used to "smooth" price action to see the underlying trend.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** A momentum oscillator. 
    * $> 70$: Overbought (Price may drop).
    * $< 30$: Oversold (Price may rise).
* **Volume:** Confirms the strength of a price move. Price rising on low volume is considered a "weak" move.
