# Offer Letter Traps: How Companies Are Fooling You

### Overview
Important hidden traps in offer letters that freshers often overlook, which can impact salary, job role, growth, and exit process significantly.

---

## 1. CTC vs In-Hand Salary
- CTC = Total package including fixed pay, bonuses, ESOPs, insurance.
- In-hand salary much lower: CTC minus bonuses, ESOPs, PF, taxes.
- Variable pay > 40% means low guaranteed salary.
- **Action:** Always request full salary breakdown during interviews.

---

## 2. Job Title and Responsibilities
- Job title in offer letter should match interview discussions.
- Vague or marketing titles can hide actual duties.
- **Action:** Ask for detailed job description and verify on LinkedIn.

---

## 3. Probation Period Trap
- Probation can be extended from 3 months to even years.
- No confirmation = no benefits, lower job security.
- **Action:** Confirm probation length and confirmation criteria (avoid "management discretion").

---

## 4. Notice Period and Bond Agreements
- Long notice periods (up to 90 days) restrict mobility.
- Bonds may include penalties or restrict exit.
- **Action:** Check notice period duration, bond terms, and buyout options.

---

## 5. Leave Policy
- Leaves often denied or unpaid during probation.
- Manager's discretion often limits leave approval.
- **Action:** Clarify leave entitlements and approval process in writing.

---

## 6. Growth and Training
- No mention of training or promotion means stagnant roles.
- High attrition or stagnant LinkedIn profiles = red flags.
- **Action:** Ask about training programs and promotion criteria.

---

## 7. Company Culture and Stability
- Check employee reviews on Glassdoor, AmbitionBox, Reddit.
- Look for high turnover, layoffs, or toxic culture signs.
- **Action:** Research financial health and funding history (Crunchbase, news).

---

## 8. Offer Validity
- Offers can be provisional with no guaranteed joining.
- Missing joining date = no job security.
- **Action:** Confirm finality of offer and fixed joining date.

---

## 9. Full and Final Settlement (FNF)
- Companies may delay final payments or withhold dues.
- **Action:** Request FNF breakup and payment timeline.

---

## 10. Additional Tips
